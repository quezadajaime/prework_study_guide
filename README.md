## Description

My motivation was to better understand web development and how text and code can create something we take for granted when working daily on a GUI.
This project was built to introduce new Webdevlopers to the anatomy of webdevelopment.
Hopefully this helps people intrested in this field get a crash course on what to expect.
I learned the beginings of what a website intales.
